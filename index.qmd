Hi! I am a recent graduate of John Cabot University with a BA in International Affairs! 

I have a passion for governance, democracy, and international cooperation. With a strong foundation in comparative politics, international humanitarian law, and data analysis and visualization, I am excited to tackle the problems at the intersection of these sectors. On this website you will find a showcase of my recent projects, demonstrating my ability to analyze and visualize historical trends aimed at academic and policy applications.
